# leaderboard-meteor
Leaderboard is a small, simple Meteor application I built to show the basics of MeteorJS.

To run, make sure you have meteor installed with:
`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

Once you verified Meteor is installed, clone this repository, navigate to the folder and run:
`meteor`

This will start a fresh Leaderboard application. 

*Note: you will have to sign up to use the application.*
